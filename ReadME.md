# ANLC - Anthologies, Niches, Lore & Conspiracy by Kasey Hearts
A writer blog hosted by GitHub to compile and journal-ized (here's to letting me make up words :p) any writing ideas that lead to a bigger picture for my OG WIPs that refuse any completion stranded in limbo. To un-limbo myself, the idea snippets, first chapters, short stories, history and settings and my tropes would be consistently published 2 - 3 days per week. To build up the writing muscle, to feel like I'm going somewhere, to apply consistency and discipline without the fear blanking.

Live Demo here: https://d3lk1ch1.github.io/Writer-Blog/

## Features
* Layout: Signature at top with Name. About at the bottom (Done)
* Header: Anthologies, Niches, Lore, Conspiracies (Done)
* Side-bar: Search-box for tags that update upon themselves depending on what I blog ex: #shortstories #antiBL #prologue #lore #mystery etc (In Progress)
* Center: Where people pull up my blogs (Done)
* Blogs: Have a comment section for anyone that bothers (Done - Only GitHub users can comment on posts, because using GitHub to host the page.)

## Tech Stack / Configuration
* Jekyll, in creating this blog. I'm leaving it to the documentation and hope it fits my criteria -> Update: A learning process but tackling the basics down - from using AI to aid me and then doing the core bits myself the second time to know what is necessary and what has been unnecessarily added by AI. Can less be more?

## Test Cases - Will be waiting for feedback for all once launched
* Ensure that the link goes somewhere (Fixed with a vengeance)
* Ensure that it is hosted properly (Managed)
* Ensure that it is synced well with GitHub to add more posts (Pending)

Feedback is always appreaciated, from my writing skills to my coding workflow that I could honestly do better, especially integrating AI.
