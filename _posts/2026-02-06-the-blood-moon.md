What makes the moon glow red? It doesn't happen every full moon, but it always does happen on a full moon and never half, quarter or new, as bright as the fiery sun and yet fiery tainted in darkness, glowing most ominously for graveyards especially like a bloody wave over bodies that now bleed a whole lot less on what once gave life.

The general consensus had been devilry, for what else a fresh wave of blood favouring graveyards tainting an already gloomy atmosphere into the depths of evil. It had been further proven for the ominious, the devil's luck itself gracing the population in those nights from unexplained clumsiness, festering crime and a rise in victims. A witch's night, people had whispered. The devil at foot, people had agreed. A bad omen together.

Truly concluded, by an incident that still scarred a small village-town's simple graveyard where a blood moon had glowed eerily bright. Right at a newly dug graveyard, mourning a young chap simply gone by nature's whimsical accidents right into a river at one's folly. Friends had retrieved the body, and the eerie coldness without any response that subsequent panic had driven action to revive had simply declared the man dead. The doctor that came after simply bowed his head, doing even more than those friends to confirm what had been dreaded true at first touch, with the eerie coldness never belonging otherwise to warm alive flesh. 

What they had thought true, after the funeral and solemn wake simply stating 'He was young.' And yet the young were more inclined to life, as truth inverted in the ominous blood moon when a hand reached out the grave digging out the young man that had been dead only for a day and buried mere hours. Breathing, eyes darting and thoughts spinning, to finally spot a person, just wanting to inquire.

That person had been the undertaker, doing his daily rounds in the graveyard to witness the strangest sight beyond his wildest nightmares even when he knew this night like no other always carried an unease for something bad to happen.

Before the young man could even utter a sound, could continue living, the undertaker in fear with ideas about the devil-touched instead of miracles at such a horrifying site about a dead man coming back to life when even the undertaker who had helped with the body's burial felt how far from life the man had been with the coldest flesh embraced most deeply within Death, he had took up the knife that he already kept close for dangers such as this and stabbed the young man right in the heart, real blood mingling with the red waving light passing off for blood in the graveyard.

Staring at each other in shock, as the man had reached for the knife in shock, the undertaker feared he might be witnessing the real undead when the man so much had twitched, could still move his hand, could still show such an _expression_ on his face but the man's eyes rolled upward with a lurch forward at first for the undertaker to feel the same cold skin only mixed with surpising warm blood befre falling back to the grave. Truly dead.

That had been decades ago, discovered the very next day and weaved into a story about the terrible blood moon. The young undead, never deserving to leave so early and how the blood moon grants just the warmest blood to the coldest flesh in order to continue living. It was confirmed for the youth because it's within those same decades that graverobbers had started searching through graves and were truly shocked at how young the chap looked even in death. Not bones and skeleton that rot over time
