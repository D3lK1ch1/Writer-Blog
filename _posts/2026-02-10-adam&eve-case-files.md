This is a tale of many men and a singular woman, offering the forbidden fruit and coveted by many maybe in competition, others in ambition and most certainly in desire morally or not. These men and woman would eventually tie themselves together in heinous fate, delivered by the woman herself towards the men that would find their bonds throughout tried, tested and probably cherished or ruin.

Rise up or fall into ruin. Alone or with others alongside. The possibilities, twists and turns and especially consequences are endless, stirred up by a singular person not part of the cast.

No, the person would consider themselves a narrator or even humbly a spectator humming at the thought  of the sample people with a simple action, the forbidden fruit, that would lead to a chain of different events with multiple different endings yet with the same result only hoped for within the simple action.

This humble spectator was merely an aristocrat, famous for their benevolence and infamous for their whimsy. It certainly led  an easy and yet easily bored life edging to meaningless, only stopped short from falling straight off with behind the scene wonders called conspiracies ranging from assassins to aliens and just fueling off his whimsy.

Sometimes it was happily kept to themselves, and others more an anomymous treat that could collectively lose people's minds. But they can admit that it was never kept too long, just accumulated until the right timing for moving forward while hiding away valuable information only leads to stagnation, a dearth to the world.

And finally, they felt they hit the jackpot, upon numerous conspiracies tied to a singular woman branching out to many ther men in the small and big events. Together in whimsical fashion, they can only turn it into a game, the idea of each finding the other's conspiracy, and what they would do when faced with such decisions.

_The actress, looking for her priest father._

_The cop, the antique toy shop owner and a nightlifer in a bar, staring at one soggy newspaper._

_The idler, more than he seems, off to see the Queen, and getting more than he would ever bargain for._

_The chemist and his assistant, where research had taken a life of its own._

_The detective thinking to enjoy more of his morning tea, seeing the cards fall from the sky._

_The dancer, practing for a routine that will be all and end all._

_The hardworking giant, for what will happen when you find out more than the identity you have ever known?_

_The doctor, spilling more blood within the collection of knives abound somehow intersecting with the detective, the dancer and the hardworking giant. This means something and nothing at all._

_A museum director, always willing for his next collection. Always eying for the next one._

_A right hand man, for who that deserves the respect of one without an incomplete job?_

_And a gamer, fingers more dextrous and luck more plentiful than the RPGs and the gachas he contends too._

**They all may not connect, but find the intersections, the tipping point and what would one get out of them?**

It was much better than the same old song and dance of exposing anything on their own, although they would have to tip the dominoes just a little bit or else they will never fall. It found inspiration from the tale of Adam and Eve, with countless versions where the original may forever be lost to time for who could truly know what would happen in the story itself except for the very people that never knew stories let alone the written word existed. And yet the original meaning had never been lost.

The first man and the first woman, in paradise. The woman eating the forbidden sin, followed and offered to the man casting them down to earth by God for disobeying them, aptly named in the modern world as the Fall. Simplistic, but to the point.

And now here they were again, a woman but with many more men, with much situations easily relating to such a story like how all stories connect each other in this world. Eve to start it off followed by Adam. Eve toppling the chain of events for Adam, by dangling the apple of sin in front of her and leading to the conclusive Fall.

_The actress had received a box, armed with a letter and her father's last words. She was no longer an actress, but a priest's daughter. A nun if not scouted otherwise, and a duty to family. One that cannot be done alone, one that determined crossed paths._

What will be shown? What will be uncovered?

_An apple, a fig and a red drop. Sharing only the similarity of redness, bloodying what lies underneath._

_The fire beckons and sees a coward, one so strong turned into absolutely apathy and yet faced again, intersecting with-_

_A research most heinous and well-hidden, rediscovered once more tying up to a science incomprehensible and yet altogether tempting._

_The trail must be followed to the very end, crossing paths with old friends and new enemies._

_A phantom thief once more strikes, so obvious by the routines that bound them, with a singular calling card!_

_An identity found once more, linked with who but hardwork meant fiery determination and can only be met with such zeal._

_Every collection added belies a meaning unknown, and for that, pity those that had paths crossed._

_Fear the loyal, because against only means an enemy most foul. Loyalty, against, depends on the criteria that deems enemies._

_No one's friend, no one's enemy. Just solo, but what happens in co-op?_

**Which route then would interest more, which route would  tie it altogether, which route?**

It bubbled them with excitement and they could only flip through a notebook that recorded the start, and the fall of it all... superseded by many events both singular and yet a chapter for more to come.

So, come and read...

## Writer's Notes
It was supposed to be a fanfiction, but it can do really well as an OG, or basically even a game itself. I admit this is inspired by Diabolik Lovers in a Sherlock-esque universe, with Yui and the capture targets in a more sadistic era trying to solve mysteries and uncover conspiracies. With Sherlock-esque story, and inspiration to a few other detective stories in mind, the characters will be certainly a mix with the Sherlock stories weaved wonderfully into the characters. So yeah, I have at least one branch ready for the picking. So I can't wait for that free-write.
