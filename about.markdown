Welcome to my blog, standing for anthologies, niches, lore and conspiracies. For the longest time, I have been a reader who developed my writing styles and habits through my cringe era Wattpad phase, gathering the courage to move from fanfiction done with love for the characters and what-if scenarios they deserve to novels inspired but won't break the plagarism code via fandom. A long and solitary venture with fleeting ideas, rooted and yet not seen for the bigger picture. I have a number of excuses from academic ventures draining my mental capacities to write thanks to stress, the external pressure that fears one-star reviews and why bother and so forth to why a full-fledged novel hasn't been written over the years as the first step of authorhood and this blog in its own way is meant to overcome it, to replace stress with a consistent unbroken flow, to outcast the external pressure and reclaim the joy about ideas put down and now made more real in this blog to see the progress, the timestamps and not let them go, marking them forevermore here and knowing that everything I have done would never be in vain. I just have to keep going.

So instead of writing novels, this blog breaks them down or pivots to something simpler while keeping my writing consistent, seen and known because if I continue to write my novels with doubts, I can look at the stories I see here and not lose vision.

Anthologies - basically short stories and poems inspired by novel snippets, day-to-day ventures, your everyday what-ifs. I would also post my WIPs prologues here, just to see where they will lead to. Know they are a goal to be reached.

Niches - A friend of mine once said that a trope I like was very niche. You had think that after all these years, we would have ventured every trope under the sun. At the very least, nothing is stopping me from using this blog to promote anti-mance, or more specifically BH (Boys Hate - and yes, the label is a WIP). If there are anymore tropes I can turn around on its head, then my creativity is at the ready.

Lore - This is more involved with my novels, because apparently I can't just revolve the world around my protagonist and antagonist. This is a cross between behind-the-scenes in the story and what had inspired me to base off the story by that. It helps me build up the world with what I know and explore around their history aka lore and see how it shapes up to be for my own story era.

Conspiracies - I feel like this would be the least written but hey I'm open minded to make up shiz and see how you will get on with it.

Updates every 2 - 3 days per week, just so I no longer stop writing, stop building up my stories and one day proudly finish a novel.

PS I don't care that you found this knowing my real name. Let me live my young dreams of 'getting the riches not the fame' mindset my heart and soul set out to in making the pseudonym Kasey Hart.
